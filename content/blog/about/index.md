> Continue to Learn How to Learn

I love to build something and it solves problem. Now I'm learning Data Science and how to apply them in real business.
There are many problems in this world and we believe that science can help and solve them. I want to be part of the problem solving community. 

I love helping and supporting other people out there. I believe everyone in this world have unlimited potential as long as they realize what they love and and what problems they have to solve. My mission is to bring their potentials and motivations to the real world. In order to achieve this, I have to learn how to learn every single day. There are no ends. Amazingly, this learning energy overflows quickly and it becomes a stream of energy which will soon change the world.
